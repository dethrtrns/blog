    When we think of people who are known for their astonishing creativity, it’s easy to assume that they were somehow born different from the rest of us, with minds wired to forge new connections and see the world in a novel way. 
    
    We forget that apparent geniuses often spent years on less successful projects – practice that helped to hone their thinking until they finally created something truly original. The fact is that almost every great writer, artist or inventor underwent a period of ‘apprenticeship’ in which they learnt how to develop and refine their ideas before they had any major breakthroughs. 
    
    “Many people simply don’t know that creativity is a trainable skill,” says Professor Gerard Puccio, who chairs the Department for Creativity and Change Leadership at SUNY Buffalo State College, US. And this assumption – that creativity is innate, rather than learnt – can be very off-putting whenever we are tasked with original thinking. 
    
    With a steady stream of research, however, psychologists like Puccio have identified the best ways to kickstart the learning process. Their evidence shows that, with practice, we can all learn to think more originally in our day-to-day lives, building greater innovation – and fulfilment – into whatever we choose to do. 
    
    **Thinking skills **

    Of the many creativity-training programmes out there, Puccio’s Thinking Skills Model offers one of the best-tested attempts to teach workplace creativity. 

    The programme emphasises the need to balance two types of thinking: convergent and divergent. Divergent thinking is the kind of free-wheeling idea generation that we often associate with the stereotypically scatty inventor, with novel – if sometimes hairbrained – solutions to problems. Convergent thinking, in contrast, concerns the selection and development of the best ideas to make sure that they have potential use. 

    Both are essential. Without the former, your ideas will be too mundane and boring; without the latter, they may be impractical.
    
    > ***Almost every great writer, artist or inventor underwent a period of ‘apprenticeship’ in which they learnt how to develop and refine their ideas***
        
    After learning these concepts, people trained in the Thinking Skills Model are taught to apply divergent and convergent thinking in seven distinct steps that are thought to be essential for most creative problems: assessing the situation, exploring the vision, formulating the challenges, exploring ideas, formulating solutions, exploring acceptance and formulating a plan. 

    In one recent trial, Puccio recruited 559 participants from the university. This included people who had taken no creativity training, people who had attended a three-day course based on the Thinking Skills Model, and those who had undergone much more extensive education, such as completing SUNY’s master’s degree in creativity, which also involved a cognitive approach to improve original thinking as well as ambitious projects to put the theory into practice. 

    During the experiment, the participants were split into small groups, according to their level of creativity training, and asked to come up with ways of encouraging people to use the bus network in the Greater Buffalo, New York area. Their solutions were rated by independent judges on qualities such as flexibility – whether the group were considering a wide range of ideas – and originality. 

    As you might hope, the groups of people who had undergone some creativity training performed much better than those without any training or guidance – generating four times as many original ideas. There also appeared to be differences between the training programmes; participants from the three-day course produced 67 original ideas, on average, while those who had undergone more extensive education produced 81. 

    That may seem like a modest improvement, given the differences in time commitment between the short course and a master’s degree. Importantly, however, those with the advanced training were also more skilled at selecting, developing and refining their proposals. Puccio points out that they often combined multiple ideas, for instance – whereas this possibility did not seem to occur to the other groups. This meant that their final solutions were substantially better than those of the other groups.

    Clearly, a quick primer in creativity can provide an immediate boost to people’s thinking – but it can’t make up for regular and sustained practice. “Creativity is damn hard work,” says Puccio. “It takes a lot of time to develop these skills, like the critical thinking to determine which are the most promising ideas.” 

    Martin Meinel recently tested a creativity-training programme at Germany’s Friedrich-Alexander- Universität in Erlangen-Nürnberg, with very similar conclusions. “You can think of creativity as a muscle,” he says – it needs constant practice to grow and to remain strong. 

    With a little work, you may be surprised by your progress, says Meinel – even if you have never shown any great feats of creativity previously.  “The ones who were least creative at the beginning, they made the biggest gains.” 

    **Primed to learn**

    This is all true, provided you start out with the right mindset. Ella Miron-Spektor, an associate professor of organisational behaviour at the INSEAD business school in Fontainebleau, France, has shown that people’s beliefs and attitudes to work will have a big impact on their creative development. 

    Some people, she says, are “performance-oriented”: they are very concerned about how they compare to others. In general, they see their talents as fixed, and so prefer to stick to tasks that will consistently result in a success. A failure, for someone who is performance oriented, would be deeply discouraging. “They tend to take feedback more personally,” says Miron-Spektor. “They think that if you are unable to perform well, it's because of the lack of capability – and it's not something you can develop.” 

    Others are “learning-oriented”: they tend to be more focused on the opportunity to increase their skills and broaden their knowledge. They are also more resilient in the face of failure, since they analyse what went wrong and use those lessons as an opportunity for growth. 

    To see whether these mindsets could influence people’s creativity over time, Miron-Spektor examined the employees of a large electro-optical manufacturer in Israel. The management had introduced an innovation programme, asking employees to submit any ideas that might improve processes or products. Each idea was evaluated by an expert panel, who rated the potential of the proposal and gave feedback to the original inventor. 
    
    > ***Soon, you may find your brain is “programmed” so that it automatically thinks of ingenious solutions***
        
    Looking at seven years of data from the scheme, Miron-Spektor was able to plot each employee’s “creativity trajectory” and compare them to the results of questionnaires measuring people’s learning or performance orientations. Overall, she found that the learning-oriented employees showed greater improvement in the number and quality of ideas they contributed to the scheme, compared to those who were performance-oriented, who tended to give up and stop trying after they had faced a disappointment. 

    “It's not just that the people with the learning orientation are more creative, on average; we saw that they learned faster, so they were able to improve their creativity over time,” says Miron-Spektor. 

    **The creative life**     

    The most obvious conclusion from these studies might be that businesses could invest in more training for their teams – rather than assuming that creativity will flow automatically. Importantly, however, they also need to create the right working environment to promote a learning orientation in employees. “You have to encourage people to treat failure as part of the process,” Miron-Spektor says. This should be evident in the overall corporate culture, but also in the ways that managers give feedback – to frame the criticisms as opportunities for future growth. 

    Puccio agrees that leaders’ attitudes can make a crucial difference. “If a leader’s behaviour is not aligned to this new set of creative-thinking skills, the impact is limited,” he says. 

    Even small pieces of guidance can offer employees an initial head start. In Puccio’s experiment, some of the participants with no previous training were told to separate their problem solving into two distinct stages – idea generation (involving divergent thinking) and idea selection (using convergent thinking). He found that they were subsequently much more creative than those who were left to their own devices. 

    If you hope to enhance your own creativity, Meinel recommends regularly testing yourself in the small problems that you encounter. We all have certain routines that we use to deal with common tasks, but you might start to consider whether there are alternatives – and more original – ways of dealing with them. Soon, you may find your brain is “programmed” so that it automatically thinks of ingenious solutions, he says. 

    With time, idea generation and refinement will become second nature – a “habit of creativity” that allows you to tackle life’s bigger problems with greater flare and originality.

    description: `A few of the most essential and helpful building blocks that can help your workflow take off.`,
    content: `
      As you work to cultivate a productive workflow for yourself and set off to get some real work done, you’re likely to run into some sticking points on your journey. Don’t worry, it’s all normal.

      Once you have more than one project to focus on, you’ll need something to help you keep track of them. Once your work takes you beyond your desk—to a meeting, or a new workplace, or traveling somewhere on a plane—you’ll need systems to keep you productive wherever you are. And as you continue on your work journey for weeks and months and years, and you face classic obstacles of disorganization, complacency, and overwhelm. In those moments, you could probably use some tools to help keep you grounded, and on track.
      
      Luckily, there are tried-and-true tools and systems out there that have been proven to work for all types of work and all types of people. These aren’t the productivity-guru-snake-oil-app-type of tools you’ve been getting ads for on Facebook. These are the basics. The essentials. Your starter kit.
      
      Here are a few of the most essential and helpful building blocks that can help your workflow take off.
      
      1. **THE HUMBLE TO-DO LIST**
      
      It’s deceptively simple, but the to-do list might be the single most important element to a productive person’s life. You could be forgiven for finding it almost too simplistic. But its value actually increases the more complicated one’s life gets.
    
      The more responsibilities and activities that we take on in our lives, between work, school, play, and side hustles, the more chances we create for things to slip through the cracks. You’re probably familiar with the feeling of walking through your day in a bit of a fog, feeling unsettled, because you know that there’s something you need to do that you just can’t remember.

        Or, you’ve been in a scenario at work or school where someone or something dumps a mountain of tasks on you in a matter of seconds or minutes. You’re probably familiar with the instinct to almost immediately start to cycle through them in your head as you walk away, to make sure you don’t forget one. Those memories always feel like dull panic and dread. And it’s not necessary.

        The goal of a to-do list, and the reason it’s so important to your productive life, is simple. It’s about getting that mountain of tasks and ideas out of your head, where they’re swimming around loosely and clouding your focus, and into a singular place in the physical world.

        Once they’re there, the list can be 200 items long. It might be a little unwieldy, but at least it’s complete. At least it’s centralized. It can be a list of tasks, a grocery list, or a checklist to consult each time before finishing a project. And now you can go through your life – to dinner, to work, on a walk – and not have to worry about forgetting something, or feeling that tip of the tongue feeling in your brain.

        It’s all good. It’s all sorted. It’s all on your list, and it’s a complete document. If you think of something new, just add it to the list. Once you’ve created your list, you can go through and edit it, condense it, combine items, omit others – whatever you need. But the hard part will be done.

        It’s important, though, that this is the one and only list. If it’s in any other place than the one place you’ve designated, you won’t have that same security of mind. If there are too many places it could be, including nowhere at all, it might as while be gone.

        This system can take the form of a piece of a paper if you want. If you’re one of those people that actually carries around a physical notepad or moleskin, this is your time to shine. But the vast majority of us are looking for a smartphone app. I have two recommendations. First is Todoist, a full-featured and robust app with a lot of fun tricks like natural language processing (so you can type “coffee with Dave at 2pm Tuesday” and it will understand and add it your calendar without asking) and multi-layered folder and organization systems. It’s a favorite of many productivity warriors.

        My personal favorite, though, is an app called MinimaList. As its name suggests, the experience is pretty…well, minimal. It’s a blank screen, you pull down anywhere to add an item, and press enter to submit it. Swipe across them to cross them off. That’s it. You can swipe around and do little gestures to find a couple extra hidden features and settings, but if you just wanted a simple app that was as plain as writing on a sheet of paper, this is the one for you. I love its simplicity. I just write whatever’s in my head and go. Figure it out later.

        2. **ANY AND ALL WRITING**
        
        Writing apps are a little different than to-do lists, of course. They still often function as a way to quickly intake thoughts, but they’re more formless by design. You can write in any format you see fit. They can also expand to fit longer form documents, which, depending on your line of work, might be the most single most important element to your productivity suite. I know it is for mine.

        So choosing your process here is really important. Props to you if you’re a pen and paper type here, but you’re still likely going to need a way to digitize what you write. Are you cool with re-typing it all after the fact? Many make that a part of their process by doing their first round of edits as they re-type.

        On the digital side, there’s a wide swath to choose from. Literally untold millions are perfectly content with Microsoft Word. And if that’s you, that’s more than fine. But others need specific feature sets and formats for mediums like screenwriting. Others want something even more minimalistic. Consider what your needs are, and if you’ve ever felt frustrated by limitations of an app you’ve previously used.

        I have two systems. One is for quick intake ideas, like “a TV show where all the firefighters are dogs” or whatever. File that away under “Genius Ideas, 2021,” and when you pull it out, take it into your longform writer of choice to plot it out, structure it, and write it.

        For that longer-form work, where you’re going to spend hours in a particular computer window with the blinking cursor, your priority should be something that doesn’t interrupt your flow. And for your quick intake solution, you need something that, when an idea pops into your head, doesn’t make you wait staring at a loading screen or some other delay in those precious seconds where you might lose your thought. Humans are prodigious at forgetting things.

        I’ve downloaded notes apps that were probably very good and deleted them immediately when I saw they had an ad at the bottom of the screen. Or worse, found a way to introduce some kind of payment plan to unlock more features or “unlimited” notes. A notes app has to be simple, and unaffected by the outside world. I need a blinking cursor, a perfunctory file-and-folder system, and nothing else to get in the way.

        I’m a big proponent of Apple Notes, and it’s easy syncing across all devices. But, according to my RescueTime, my most-used writing app is the stock notepad TextEdit, which is overly simplistic almost to a fault. But, when I have an idea, all I have to do is go “command-spacebar-T-enter” and it’s there. It happens in less of a second nowadays. I wouldn’t trade that kind of speed for almost anything. So go with what you feel like.

        My recommendation for long-form writing is an app called Highland 2. I think it’s a gorgeous and vastly underrated writing experience. It was originally conceptualized as a screenwriting app, and that’s what it truly excels at, but it has modes for all kinds of writing. I do all my article and essay writing there too. I’m writing this article in it right now, in fact. (Sorry, it’s an Apple exclusive.)

        3. **DREADED EMAIL**
        
        As I’m sure you’re aware, email has inserted itself into our corporate and productive lives so firmly over the last decade that no matter how many Slacks and Zooms and WhatsApps come along, I don’t foresee it going away for a very, very long time. So, while we’re here, you might as well embrace the process of optimizing and idealizing your email experience.

        That starts with aggressively unsubscribing from shopping digests and other spam-like messages, and even newsletters that might be good but that you don’t read. Your inbox should be for things you either need to see or are excited to see. Not things that will sit around collecting dust.

        Spend a few available hours working through at least the top layer of your emails. You hear people talk about “Inbox Zero” all the time, and for good reason. There are few things that feel so good as having your inbox completely cleared out, especially if you’ve been walking around with that “3000 unread emails” tag on your home screen for months and years. It’s like finishing a to-do list you started in middle school.

        (If you’ve been buried in email as long as you remember and want to “cheat code” your way to a fresh start, you can at the very least “select-all and mark as read” for all the email in your inbox so that the huge red number will go away. Here’s how to do it in Gmail.)

        The nice thing about email is that, if you use Gmail, and you probably do, you don’t need an app. The browser experience is simple and sturdy enough to handle anything you could need it to. Google-integrated search and indexing makes the experience a dream—especially if you’ve accumulated years of archived and sorted messages.

        But if you’re itching for an app you can put on your dock and tab between, I recommend Spark. It’s got a beautiful layout, and is deeply customizable, especially with keyboard shortcuts.

        So spend some time getting to Inbox Zero, or whatever your version of it looks like. Then, commit to a workflow with your email. You don’t have to delete everything once you’re done with it – I know firsthand the paralysis that digital packrat-ism can create with things like email. The archive button is your friend. Deal with things as they come in. Reply to emails immediately, or if they need a little extra time, mark them as unread so they stay highlighted. Now that red badge will be a low number like “6” and you’ll actually have an idea of what to do with it.

        There’s a blankness to the feeling of true inbox zero that honestly is a jolt of energy. Gmail gives you a nice little picture when there’s nothing left in your inbox. And the app icon on your iPhone looks gorgeous without that garish red badge.

        4. **A BIRD’S-EYE CALENDAR**
        
        I used to float through life without a calendar. In college, I would have little sticky notes or scraps of paper dotted around my life that said, “meeting with professor Tuesday at 12:00.” I think I must have had a print-out of my schedule from the first syllabus day of each semester that would just sit on my desk, gathering folds and wrinkles, as I consulted it five times a day. Who knows how I pulled any of that off. (The real answer: I didn’t. A lot slipped through the cracks.)

        Even when I started my career as a freelancer and had different jobs every week, each with its own details and schedules and stacks of paperwork, I tried to maintain the same charade. I made it a few months before I realized it was nearly impossible—professional life just begs for some kind of structure. So I went in the complete opposite direction.

        Every time I get a job or a commitment, in my work life or personal life, it goes on the calendar. I have them color-coded for “Work,” “Personal,” “Health,” “Family,” and “Travel.” “Work” is red because it stresses me out. “Travel” is grey because even at its most enjoyable, it’s still aggressively “neutral”-feeling time. “Health” is green because…salads are healthy?

        I follow a philosophy I’ve heard others in the productivity community espouse: “If it’s not on my calendar, it didn’t happen.”

        I can now see my life from a wonderful top-down perspective. A sea of red in the middle of the month? I’m working. I have no room for seeing a movie with a friend. Did I play basketball this month? Not seeing a lot of blue or green on the weekends – I should probably make room for that this week so I get some exercise and fresh air. And in a macro sense, I just get a really good idea of how my days are filling up, and what I’m devoting time to. Am I working enough? Am I working too much?

        And once you get going doing this, you start to get addicted to adding things to your calendar. It feels endlessly productive like you’re putting a stamp of officialness on an activity—confirming it happened or ensuring that it will happen. I’ve started to notice other people adopting similar dedication to their calendars and their days. Some of the more productive people in my life will plan a 15-minute meeting with me and then buzz my phone with a calendar invite two minutes later. My phone will buzz again two minutes before the event, just in case I forgot. And then when it’s over, and my day is over, it will still be there, burned onto the day on the calendar.

        Google Calendar is my app of choice. It’s got lovely native layouts and design, but it also syncs effortlessly to your Apple or Windows-based stock calendars, so you can access them anywhere through any app. Google and Apple let you turn different categories on and off, so I can look at just my work life or just my personal life on their own, for example.

        Try adding things to your calendar slowly, starting with work and super necessary-to-remember things, and see how you like it. There might be a subtle feeling of calm that comes with knowing that your day is laid out in front of you, and behind you, in perfect clarity. And you’ll probably miss fewer Tuesday meetings.

        5. **TRACKING YOUR TIME**
        
        If you’re a freelancer that bills by the hour, you’ve probably yearned for some kind of system that will take the guesswork and head-scratching memory spelunking that comes with having to remember in and out times and billable hours, at the end of a long workday no less. Luckily for you, there are more modern solutions than duck taping your kitchen timer and Sharpie-ing the word “work” on it.

        The app Toggl allows you to simply press “Start” and “Stop” on a labeled timer to track the exact amount of time you spent on a task or project. For freelancers, this will allow you to split up your day and truly understand your hour-by-hour time breakdown.

        There’s a special switch that goes off in your head when you press “Start.”  In my experience, I’m more inclined to work and to work efficiently. It’s almost as if it makes you 10% or so less inclined to tab over to a time-wasting website – because you’re “on the clock.” It feels like you’re on camera even though you’re not. And if you feel seriously committed to procrastinating, might as well make it official by pressing “Stop” on your timer. No more time fraud on either side of the equation.

        And we can’t let the time tracking category pass without mentioning the time-tracking product we make here at RescueTime. RescueTime runs in the background of your computer or phone and tracks your activity – time spent on each app, and in each category of work. It will also periodically send you reports of your time spent: time spent on YouTube, or playing chess, or working broadly in the “Communication” category of email, Slack, and other messaging apps. It’s like getting a spotlight flashed on your activity – the good, the bad, the ugly, and the productive.

        For accountability, and for a bird’s-eye view of how you truly spend your time, use a combination of these apps and others like them. But RescueTime, because of the comprehensive view it provides of your activity, feels indispensable.

        6. **BLOCKING OUT THE FUN**
        
        These are the least exciting part of the process, but if you’re like me (or, really, if you’re human) they’re becoming increasingly necessary during tough, dopamine-dependent stretches.

        If you’re unfamiliar, there are apps out there that you can set to block you from accessing certain areas of the internet, or applications on your computer, or both, or everything, depending on how you set them.

        Maybe you just need to block Reddit and YouTube. But maybe Wikipedia is your sneaky faux-productive procrastination tool. Or maybe you can’t even trust yourself to not turn the New York Times and National Geographic or, I don’t know, Microsoft Powerpoint into a distraction. The procrastinating brain is a powerful and sneaky force.

        There are a couple of options here that I’ve personally used and appreciate.

        Freedom seems to be the industry standard and app of choice for many, especially in the productivity community. Its design is elegant and clean, and there’s an air about it that just makes you feel productive when you turn it on. It’s covered in a crisp, bright green, you’re accompanied by the image of a butterfly spreading its wings. Lovely stuff.

        And I really like that it’s called Freedom. It’s not called “The Lockdown Blocker 3000.” Because that’s not what you’re doing here. Just because you’re keeping yourself from using TikTok for an hour doesn’t really mean you’re depriving yourself of anything. Rather, you’re giving yourself the freedom – from yourself, from your dopamine dependences, from that stupid algorithm – to do what you truly want to. It’s powerful stuff, honestly.

        These can also extend to your mobile devices if that’s where your pain points are.

        For something a little simpler and utilitarian, there’s also Cold Turkey, which bills itself as “the toughest website blocker on the Internet.”

        The balance here is something that is hard enough to turn off but also isn’t impossible. I find when there are sufficiently four or five annoying steps required to disable something, each one will kind of chip away at the power of my laziness until my resolve and will power and catch back up and stop. Play around with the level of torture you want to unleash on yourself, but remember to deploy discipline. This is important work we’re doing here.

        7. **BUILD UP YOUR HABITS**
        
        One of my favorite recent developments in the productivity space has been a renewed focus on the power of habit. Books like Atomic Habits by James Clear and The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg have made the case that, without regular and consistent action, true change and achievement are much harder to make materialize.

        For some of us, in our darkest days of un-productivity, or during quarantine, even the simplest things can fall off. And there’s no shame in needing a little help in getting your showering or teeth brushing habits back on track.

        But for those looking to take the next step and add a writing habit, or meditation, or regular exercise, or even flossing to your routine, it can be a great help to have a helpful digital hand behind you, pushing you along the path.

        Again, like in all of these instances, you can use paper and pen for this. Jerry Seinfeld famously used a massive year-long calendar that filled his entire wall and crossed off a big red “X” every day he dedicated time to writing. “You’ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt,” he says. “Your only job is to not break the chain.” After 100 days, you’d be amazed at the things you will do to not break the streak.

        I’m currently at 972 days in a row flossing. I can’t wait till I get to 1000 days. At this point, I’ll rearrange whole aspects of my evening routine if I need to, to make sure it happens. If I ever have a weird night where I come home at 4am or something, flossing might be the only thing I do before hitting the pillow with my shoes still on. I will not break that chain, no matter what.

        And it might sound silly, but the first bursts of momentum I needed to get over that hill were being able to cross off “day 10,” and “day 30,” and “50,” and “100,” on a system that I had ascribed meaning to and took seriously.

        We have two options here for habit tracking applications. First is a well-loved standard offering, aptly called Momentum. Swipe along with your habits and watch progress bars satisfyingly fill up with green. Get push notification reminders if you’re falling behind. And even export your data to Excel so you can get real nerdy with it.

        And for a slightly more fun and “game-like” experience, there’s Habitica. This app creates a little pixelated avatar for you and gives you points when you accomplish a task or habit. You can use those points to level up your character or give it armor, or a pet, or go on an adventure. Basically, it’s a whole new type of incentive system that those of us who grew up on Ocarina of Time will be comfortable with.

        ***TAKE WHAT YOU NEED***
        
        Every person, every workflow, and every situation is different. You might not need all seven of these things in your life to feel productive and organized in your work. But odds are good you’ll benefit from at least one or two of them being added categories listed here—or you might not need them all on a regular basis. Mix and match, and experiment, and design the perfect system that works for you. You can rest assured knowing that working and experimenting with these won’t waste your time. In fact, they’re likely to make your time a whole lot more productive, and enjoyable.

    description: `From switching the fuel they use to changing flight plans so they produce fewer contrails, airlines are searching for ways to cut their impact on the climate.`,
    content: `
      Aircrafts use an incredible amount of fuel. A Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet carries 63,000 gallons (240,000 litres) of jet fuel, equal to about a 10th of an Olympic sized swimming pool, and burns through it at a rate of 4 litres (0.9 gallons) per second.
      
      This is why flying individuals, or goods, around the world is so very energy intensive – and so terrible for the climate. Just one flight can emit as much CO2 as many people do in a year, and the number of flights globally is expected to grow at an alarming pace over the coming decades.

      Compared to other sectors, aviation is a relatively small contributor to global greenhouse emissions, but it is also one of the fastest growing. Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 5% average rise in flights per year; by 2019, it accounted for 2.5% of the world's CO2 emissions.
    
      With Covid-19, flights and passenger numbers plummeted, but the number of people flying is expected to return to 2019 levels within a few years and continue to grow. All this means that we need to start doing far more on aviation emissions, and fast. But bar gradually rising efficiency in planes, little progress has been made so far on how to actually decarbonise aeroplanes
        
      > Everything, even if it's more into the future, needs to start today and we need to do it swiftly – Maarten van Dijk

      If the world hopes to limit global warming by meeting the ambitious cuts in carbon emissions set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change, aviation will need to move away from fossil fuels completely in the long term. Companies like Airbus have grand plans to develop hydrogen planes within 15 years, for example, but what can be done in the shorter term to curb the aviation industry's impact on the climate? Can we find alternative fuels to burn in our aircraft or even change the way aircraft fly so they are kinder to the planet?

        **Switch the fuel**

        In 2010,  a venture founded by Dutch airline KLM and several other partners began one of the first efforts to develop more climate-friendly alternatives to conventional kerosene.

        Little was known at the time about how to do this, says Maarten van Dijk, one of the three and managing director of SkyNRG. "But we knew that whatever happened, someone needed to get the fuel and get it into an aircraft and sell it. So that's what we started focusing on."

        Eleven years on and SkyNRG is one of a handful of companies supplying "advanced waste" biofuels to airlines. These fuels are made from recycled waste such as used cooking oil, industrial waste and agricultural and forestry residues.

        But industry-wide, the production of alternative fuels remains miniscule. The problem is that it takes time, investment and technology – as well as a strong policy push – to swap out a fuel as ubiquitous as kerosene. A recent paper from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) found that at most 5.5% of aviation fuel in the EU could come from sustainable sources by 2030, largely from advanced waste biofuels.

        Alongside advanced waste biofuel, the other main short-term sustainable alternative to fossil jet fuel is synthetic fuel made using electrochemical reactions between water and captured carbon.

        Known together as sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), these have similar chemistry to conventional jet fuel, and can be blended with fossil fuels and used on conventional planes without needing any new onboard technology. Some are already certified for use in aircrafts up to a 50:50 blend with fossil jet fuel. But the reduction in emissions each of these sustainable fuels offer compared with fossil jet fuel varies depending on how they are made and sourced.

        In 2019, 13 million gallons (50 million litres) of SAFs were used in flights, just 0.01% of global aviation fuel, meaning the industry missed a goal set in 2010 to reach 6% use by 2020. Several EU countries have already set blending mandates for SAFs: the Netherlands, for example, has said 14% of its aviation fuel must be sustainable by 2030.

        The reason so little is currently used is that these fuels are both expensive and have very limited supply. The vast majority of sustainable fuels used in aviation today come from advanced waste biofuels, but there is demand for this from other sources such as cars, trucks and ships. And as countries aim to establish more sustainable economies, making biofuels in this way could become more difficult.

        "There are competing uses for it and not a lot of availability, because who knows, in 2030, how much waste we will actually produce," says Jo Dardenne, manager of aviation at the Brussels-based non-profit Transport and Environment (T&E). "We're moving towards a more circular economy."

        T&E has warned against setting targets for clean aviation fuels too high, due to concerns over a lack of sustainable options in the short term. They warn that pushing the aviation industry to use more biofuels before reliable sources are in place could lead airlines to switch to low quality, unsustainable food-based biofuels – such as those made from palm oil and linked to deforestation.

        Electrofuels

        Synthetic fuels, on the other hand, have more potential to be scaled up. But there is almost no production right now. In order to be truly low carbon, these fuels also need to fit a strict sustainability criteria, made using clean electricity as well as a source of carbon captured from the atmosphere in the first place.

        The first flight using sustainable e-kerosene only took place this year – and even this only used 5% of it in its fuel mix. "The big problem is that at the moment, it's about three times the cost of kerosene," says Chris Lyle, chief executive of the Air Transport Economics consultancy. When scaling up, this becomes a significant issue.

        The ICCT paper sees only a small amount of synthetic fuels being used in aeroplanes by 2030, just 0.2% of the total 5.5% of SAFs it says could be used in the EU by 2030.

        Further into the future, planes could be powered entirely on hydrogen or batteries. Airbus already has plans to develop the world's first hydrogen commercial aircraft by 2035. But powering long haul flights with either of these technologies will be tricky.

        "We think that there's a role for them and breakthrough aircraft should be incentivised and innovation should help the sector decarbonise," says Dardenne. "But we are quite sceptical of the timeframe and the costs of developing these aeroplanes."

        More efficient planes

        All this means that other measures will be needed for the aviation industry to put a serious dent in its emissions in the next decade.

        "Everything, even if it's more into the future, needs to start today and we need to do it swiftly," says van Dijk. "And then everything that's left on the fossil fuel side needs to be replaced with sustainable [fuel]."

        To date, the industry has made most progress on efficiency gains in planes, with new aircrafts today around 85% more efficient than those entering service in the 1960s, and the UN's aviation agency aims to achieve 2% improvement in fuel efficiency a year up to 2050.

        But growth in flights has so far strongly outpaced these efficiency gains, and the industry's long-term projections for growth would see this continue. "Even if it's a new generation of aircraft that are more efficient, if you add to the fleet in order to grow and you still burn kerosene, then you're going to increase your emissions overall," says Dardenne.

    description: `Productivity writer and marketing strategist Nick Wolny declares, “The Pomodoro Technique is overrated, and I will die on this hill.”`,
    content: `
    People say college is a waste of money these days, but I’m inclined to disagree. The two degrees in classical French horn I completed over a decade ago didn’t give me job security or alumni connections, but they did give me the formative experiences that come with relentlessly pursuing one skill set. Classical music fired up my penchant for deliberate practice. Whenever I had a new étude or concerto to master, focused work sessions were how I made progress.

    As it turns out, I wasn’t the only student who preferred this approach. The late professor K. Anders Ericsson is best known for his 1993 study coining the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery. But that research also found another interesting anecdote that’s been less publicized: The musicians at the top of their class often practiced in larger, deeper time blocks. They also took mental breaks in between their sessions.
    
    When I later transitioned out of the arts and into marketing, I found that these longer, blockier chunks of time were better for making meaningful progress. Whether it was learning my way around emerging technologies or pumping out content, deep-focus sessions became my best friend and even helped me both work less and finish more.
    
    It’s for these reasons that I can’t seem to get into the Pomodoro Technique. If you’ve hung around entrepreneur circles for more than a hot minute, you’ve probably run into someone who swears by the 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off approach developed by then-university student Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s.
    
    Pomodoro is certainly one of the more digestible and approachable techniques for time and attention management. But it’s not the only way to work smart. And if you have to disconnect every half hour on the half-hour . . . are you ever even finding your flow in the first place? Here’s what science has to say about it.

    **WHY WE’RE WIRED TO FOCUS IN NINETY-MINUTE INCREMENTS**
    You might prefer tapping into your ultradian rhythm, which not only sounds cool but is also your body’s natural energy cycle. While researching sleep patterns and circadian rhythm in the 1950s, scientists Eugene Aserinsky, Nathaniel Kleitman, and William C. Dement noticed how the principles of REM sleep also applied to wakefulness.

    The good news is that this superhuman productivity technique is already built into you. To tap into it, however, you’ll need to get out of your own way. Ultradian rhythms rely on your endocrine system’s hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is as important as it sounds, so if your hormones are out of step you’ll have a hard time finding your flow. The classic side effects of stress, hustle, grind, and little sleep work against you rather than for you when it comes to flow state.

    Sure, you could squeeze three Pomodoros into a 90-minute block. But why interrupt yourself when you’re on a roll? If you’re not sure what flow state feels like, allocate time to try different approaches and see what works best. Then replicate your process until it becomes accessible on command.

    **HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR SCHEDULE FOR SUCCESS**

    Rather than defining productivity as doing things more quickly, consider an alternative in which productivity is taking action on those big rocks that will move the needle. If you’re not sure what that might be, here are a few ideas to get you started.

    1. Embrace “relative prioritization” 

    The Eisenhower matrix is a tried-and-true way to sort tasks into quadrants based on urgency or importance. But what if, at the end of your plotting, you still have dozens of “urgent and important” projects? Sort yourself further using relative prioritization; a rule of thumb that’s worked for me, taken from Brian Tracy’s Focal Point, is to ask yourself what one task you’d take care of if you were about to go off the grid for a month. Repeat for each task to line up your to-dos.

    2. Identify your zone of genius 

    While we’re on the topic of ideas that are overrated, let’s throw “being well rounded” in the pot as well. Gallup’s CliftonStrengths research notes that employees who feel they’re operating in their zone are three times more likely to report having an excellent quality of life and six times more likely to be engaged in their jobs. Knowing your sweet spot can help you identify not only what to prioritize, but also what to delegate or eliminate altogether.

    3. Bet on yourself

    Many of us stay plugged in all the time to try and get ahead, only to find ourselves ineffective and burnt out. Part of healthy work productivity is ensuring that you show up fresh when it’s go time. Checking your emails in bed at midnight steals cognitive energy that would be better spent recharging for tomorrow.

    Flow state is a productivity superpower that lives within each and every one of us. But unlocking it requires that you try different approaches and figure out what works for you. Test out different workflows, find your sweet spot, and your winning rhythm might be closer than you think.

      Every Coin Has Two Sides
      When you’re wavering between two equally good decisions, how do you decide what to do?
      
      You flip a coin.
      
      If it’s heads, you grill steak.
      
      If it’s tails, you bake a casserole.
      
      It’s not just about food. It’s about making a choice. When they’re both good, you can stand there forever wavering. Then you’re no better off than a leaf tossed about by the wind.
      
      You’re not helpless. You can decide. Even if you just flip a coin.
      
      Your voice is yours. It’s inside you. Like it or not, it’s there to stay. You can’t make it go away.
      
      But you can teach it how to behave.
      
      I got control over my negative voice when I traded my old assumptions for better ones.
      
      My old assumptions were a lot like anyone who struggles with self-doubt, fear, and insecurity.
      
      - You’re not good enough.
      - You don’t matter.
      - Nobody cares about you, and they never will.
      
      Did you notice something about those statements?
      
      They’re framed as absolutes.
      
      Here’s what I mean. I didn’t give conditions to those statements. I didn’t say, “If you’re an artist, you probably won’t fit in at an accounting convention.” That’s specific and pretty obvious. And it’s only absolute in that circumstance. When you say, “I’m not good enough” you imply that this is true everywhere, all the time.
      
      It’s not.
      
      Find a better frame. See the world in terms of case by case situations. You don’t have to fit in everywhere. You do fit well in some places. You’re more like a puzzle piece than a square trying to fit in a world of round holes.
      
      Celebrate that.
      
      Now let’s get a handle on your Inner Critic. It really can be on your side – believe it or not!
      
      In this post, we’ll look at three ways it can be your best friend instead of your worst enemy.
      
      Your Critic is a Refiner, Not a Destroyer
      Ovens heat things. It’s what they do.
      
      All ovens aren’t alike.
      
      Some ovens are for pottery. You put your art in and in time you bring out a masterpiece. That’s a refining oven better known as a kiln.
      
      Funeral homes have ovens, too. They’re used to turn your loved ones into ashes.
      
      Which kind of fire is your Inner Critic?
      
      It depends on what you use it for.
      
      You can use it to make you better or bitter.
      
      You use it to make you better with a few simple steps.
      
      First, write your draft fast. Give yourself a prompt and don’t stop to think. Don’t check for typos on the way. That’s like getting distracted by a squirrel when your daughter is talking to you. Push on. This is a racetrack, not a scenic highway. Get those words down and don’t worry about speeding tickets. There aren’t any on the freewriting highway.
      
      Your critic can take a nap while you vomit out your draft.
      
      This is fun. It’s like jumping into a pool. You get refreshed by getting in the water. If you stop to worry about how cold the water might be, you’ll stay on the deck forever.
      
      Once all your words are on paper, take a break. Eat lunch. Take a nap if you’re into that. You might be tired after all that effort anyway. Give your brain time to reset.
      
      Then come back and edit.
      
      Jody Picault famously said you can’t edit a blank page. No worries! You’ve got a page that if filled to the borders.
      
      Now let’s consider the point of editing, shall we?
      
      You aren’t here to tear yourself apart. You’re editing your words. You’re looking for impact – specifically, the one you intended when you sat down to write. Did you trigger the reader’s emotions? Pretend like this is someone else’s work. It will seem more like it if your break is long enough. Ask yourself, how can I maximize my impact? How can I use these words to fulfill my purpose.
      
      Then give it all you’ve got.
      
      And please, don’t forget to get excited. Your refining here, not destroying.
      
      There’s a world of difference.
      
      Your Inner Bodyguard
      When you’re carefree, pouring out your soul with no inhibitions, you might say something offensive.
      
      Since you’re blazing through your draft, you might miss it. That’s okay. You’re not worrying about it then.
      
      Your Inner Critic can sort it all out.
      
      When you run into something you wrote that gives you pause, ask yourself one question.
      
      Should I say this?
      
      If you’d say it in public where someone could punch you, then go for it.
      
      If you have no doubt you shouldn’t say it, don’t.
      
      If you’re not sure, then you can probably leave it in.
      
      I can’t guarantee no one will be offended. And who knows? Your edginess can give your message the punch it needs to reach your reader when she needs it most.
      
      It’s also a good way to stand out.
      
      Let your Inner Critic keep you from getting a bloody nose. Don’t let it keep you from speaking the truth or making an impact.
      
      Your Critic Has Your Best Interests at Heart
      Your Critic is part of you. It’s always going to be there. It’s not trying to sabotage you. It really wants the best for you.
      
      It might not always know what to do, but let’s be honest – do you?
      
      We’re all just doing the best we can.
      
      Sometimes your Critic is worth listening to. Here’s how to tell.
      
      - Will believing this make me better?
      - Will this idea really ruin everything?
      - How is this in my best interest?
      
      When you answer these questions, you’re using your head instead of your feelings. You’re responding instead of reacting. And more often than not, you’ll find yourself daring greatly and shrinking less.
      
      We’re all wired for survival. Our intentions are usually good (at least as we define them). So when your Critic starts ranting and raving, pause. Understand. Listen to hear what it’s really saying. Are you hurting? Is something wrong? What can we do to make this wrong thing right?
      
      You’ll do this again and again for as long as you live.
      
      The more you do, the less you’ll have to over time.
      
      What you’re doing when you talk back to your critic and question its assumptions is paving new mental pathways. If you’re going to be in a rut, why not be in one that serves instead of harms you?
      
      Guide your own heart. It’s got your best interests in focus.
      
      When you do, the best of you will come out in every word.

    description: `On September 29th, 1918, months before the end of World War I, a freshly assigned physician at Camp Devens military base in Massachusetts wrote the following letter to a friend and fellow doctor, and described a terrifying influenza epidemic that was now killing hundreds of his camp’s soldiers each day.`,
    content: `
      My dear Burt—

        It is more than likely that you would be interested in the news of this place, for there is a possibility that you will be assigned here for duty, so having a minute between rounds I will try to tell you a little about the situation here as I have seen it in the last week.

        As you know, I have not seen much Pneumonia in the last few years in Detroit, so when I came here I was somewhat behind in the niceties of the Army way of intricate diagnosis. Also to make it good, I have had for the last week an exacerbation of my old “Ear Rot” as Artie Ogle calls it, and could not use a stethoscope at all, but had to get by on my ability to “spot” ’em thru my general knowledge of Pneumonias. I did well enough, and finally found an old Phonedoscope that I pieced together, and from then on was all right. You know the Army regulations require very close locations etc.

        Camp Devens is near Boston, and has about 50,000 men, or did have before this epidemic broke loose. It also has the Base Hospital for the Div. of the N. East. This epidemic started about four weeks ago, and has developed so rapidly that the camp is demoralized and all ordinary work is held up till it has passed. All assemblages of soldiers taboo.

        These men start with what appears to be an attack of LaGrippe or Influenza, and when brought to the Hosp. they very rapidly develop the most viscous type of Pneumonia that has ever been seen. Two hours after admission they have the Mahogany spots over the cheek bones, and a few hours later you can begin to see the Cyanosis extending from their ears and spreading all over the face, until it is hard to distinguish the coloured men from the white. It is only a matter of a few hours then until death comes, and it is simply a struggle for air until they suffocate. It is horrible. One can stand it to see one, two or twenty men die, but to see these poor devils dropping like flies sort of gets on your nerves. We have been averaging about 100 deaths per day, and still keeping it up. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a new mixed infection here, but what I don’t know. My total time is taken up hunting Rales, rales dry or moist, sibilant or crepitant or any other of the hundred things that one may find in the chest, they all mean but one thing here—Pneumonia—and that means in about all cases death.

        The normal number of Drs. here is about 25 and that has been increased to over 250, all of whom (of course excepting me) have temporary orders—”Return to your proper Station on completion of work”—Mine says, “Permanent Duty,” but I have been in the Army just long enough to learn that it doesn’t always mean what it says. So I don’t know what will happen to me at the end of this.

        We have lost an outrageous number of Nurses and Drs., and the little town of Ayer is a sight. It takes Special trains to carry away the dead. For several days there were no coffins and the bodies piled up something fierce, we used to go down to the morgue (which is just back of my ward) and look at the boys laid out in long rows. It beats any sight they ever had in France after a battle. An extra long barracks has been vacated for the use of the Morgue, and it would make any man sit up and take notice to walk down the long lines of dead soldiers all dressed up and laid out in double rows. We have no relief here; you get up in the morning at 5:30 and work steady till about 9:30 P.M., sleep, then go at it again. Some of the men of course have been here all the time, and they are TIRED.

        If this letter seems to be somewhat disconnected overlook it, for I have been called away from it a dozen times, the last time just now by the Officer of the Day, who came in to tell me that they have not as yet found at any of the autopsies any case beyond the Red Hep. stage. It kills them before it gets that far.

        I don’t wish you any hard luck Old Man but do wish you were here for a while at least. It’s more comfortable when one has a friend about. The men here are all good fellows, but I get so damned sick of Pneumonia that when I eat I want to find some fellow who will not “Talk Shop” but there aint none nohow. We eat it, live it, sleep it, and dream it, to say nothing of breathing it 16 hours a day. I would be very grateful indeed it you would drop me a line or two once in a while, and I will promise you that if you ever get into a fix like this, I will do the same for you.

        Each man here gets a ward with about 150 beds (Mine has 168), and has an Asst. Chief to boss him, and you can imagine what the paper work alone is—fierce—and the Government demands all paper work be kept up in good shape. I have four day nurses and five night nurses (female) a ward-master, and four orderlies. So you can see that we are busy. I write this in piecemeal fashion. It may be a long time before I can get another letter to you, but will try.

        *Good By old Pal,

      Dear Mia and Isabelle,

      I have solved all the logistical problems resulting from my death that I can think of — I am hiring a very reasonably priced cook for you and Daddy; I have left a list of instructions about who your dentist is and when your school tuition needs to be paid and when to renew the violin rental contract and the identity of the piano tuner. In the coming days, I will make videos about all the ins and outs of the apartment, so that everyone knows where the air filters are and what kind of dog food Chipper eats. But I realized that these things are the low-hanging fruit, the easy-to-solve but relatively unimportant problems of the oh so mundane.
      
      I realized that I would have failed you greatly as your mother if I did not try to ease your pain from my loss, if I didn’t at least attempt to address what will likely be the greatest question of your young lives. You will forever be the kids whose mother died of cancer, have people looking at you with some combination of sympathy and pity (which you will no doubt resent, even if everyone means well). That fact of your mother dying will weave into the fabric of your lives like a glaring stain on an otherwise pristine tableau. You will ask as you look around at all the other people who still have their parents, Why did my mother have to get sick and die? It isn’t fair, you will cry. And you will want so painfully for me to be there to hug you when your friend is mean to you, to look on as your ears are being pierced, to sit in the front row clapping loudly at your music recitals, to be that annoying parent insisting on another photo with the college graduate, to help you get dressed on your wedding day, to take your newborn babe from your arms so you can sleep. And every time you yearn for me, it will hurt all over again and you will wonder why.
      
      I don’t know if my words could ever ease your pain. But I would be remiss if I did not try.
      
      My seventh-grade history teacher, Mrs. Olson, a batty eccentric but a phenomenal teacher, used to rebut our teenage protestations of “That’s not fair!” (for example, when she sprang a pop quiz on us or when we played what was called the “Unfair” trivia game) with “Life is not fair. Get used to it!” Somehow, we grow up thinking that there should be fairness, that people should be treated fairly, that there should be equality of treatment as well as opportunity. That expectation must be derived from growing up in a rich country where the rule of law is so firmly entrenched. Even at the tender age of five, both of you were screaming about fairness as if it were some fundamental right (as in it wasn’t fair that Belle got to go to see a movie when Mia did not). So perhaps those expectations of fairness and equity are also hardwired into the human psyche and our moral compass. I’m not sure.
      
      What I do know for sure is that Mrs. Olson was right. Life is not fair. You would be foolish to expect fairness, at least when it comes to matters of life and death, matters outside the scope of the law, matters that cannot be engineered or manipulated by human effort, matters that are distinctly the domain of God or luck or fate or some other unknowable, incomprehensible force.
      
      Although I did not grow up motherless, I suffered in a different way and understood at an age younger than yours that life is not fair. I looked at all the other kids who could drive and play tennis and who didn’t have to use a magnifying glass to read, and it pained me in a way that maybe you can understand now. People looked at me with pity, too, which I loathed. I was denied opportunities, too; I was always the scorekeeper and never played in the games during PE. My mother didn’t think it worthwhile to have me study Chinese after English school, as my siblings did, because she assumed I wouldn’t be able to see the characters. (Of course, later on, I would study Chinese throughout college and study abroad and my Chinese would surpass my siblings’.) For a child, there is nothing worse than being different, in that negative, pitiful way. I was sad a lot. I cried in my lonely anger. Like you, I had my own loss, the loss of vision, which involved the loss of so much more. I grieved. I asked why. I hated the unfairness of it all.
      
      My sweet babies, I do not have the answer to the question of why, at least not now and not in this life. But I do know that there is incredible value in pain and suffering, if you allow yourself to experience it, to cry, to feel sorrow and grief, to hurt. Walk through the fire and you will emerge on the other end, whole and stronger. I promise. You will ultimately find truth and beauty and wisdom and peace. You will understand that nothing lasts forever, not pain, or joy. You will understand that joy cannot exist without sadness. Relief cannot exist without pain. Compassion cannot exist without cruelty. Courage cannot exist without fear. Hope cannot exist without despair. Wisdom cannot exist without suffering. Gratitude cannot exist without deprivation. Paradoxes abound in this life. Living is an exercise in navigating within them.
      
      I was deprived of sight. And yet, that single unfortunate physical condition changed me for the better. Instead of leaving me wallowing in self-pity, it made me more ambitious. It made me more resourceful. It made me smarter. It taught me to ask for help, to not be ashamed of my physical shortcoming. It forced me to be honest with myself and my limitations, and eventually to be honest with others. It taught me strength and resilience.
      
      You will be deprived of a mother. As your mother, I wish I could protect you from the pain. But also as your mother, I want you to feel the pain, to live it, embrace it, and then learn from it. Be stronger people because of it, for you will know that you carry my strength within you. Be more compassionate people because of it; empathize with those who suffer in their own ways. Rejoice in life and all its beauty because of it; live with special zest and zeal for me. Be grateful in a way that only someone who lost her mother so early can, in your understanding of the precariousness and preciousness of life. This is my challenge to you, my sweet girls, to take an ugly tragedy and transform it into a source of beauty, love, strength, courage, and wisdom.
      
      Many may disagree, but I have always believed, always, even when I was a precocious little girl crying alone in my bed, that our purpose in this life is to experience everything we possibly can, to understand as much of the human condition as we can squeeze into one lifetime, however long or short that may be. We are here to feel the complex range of emotions that come with being human. And from those experiences, our souls expand and grow and learn and change, and we understand a little more about what it really means to be human. I call it the evolution of the soul. Know that your mother lived an incredible life that was filled with more than her “fair” share of pain and suffering, first with her blindness and then with cancer. And I allowed that pain and suffering to define me, to change me, but for the better.
      
      In the years since my diagnosis, I have known love and compassion that I never knew possible; I have witnessed and experienced for myself the deepest levels of human caring, which humbled me to my core and compelled me to be a better person. I have known a mortal fear that was crushing, and yet I overcame that fear and found courage. The lessons that blindness and then cancer have taught me are too many for me to recount here, but I hope, when you read what follows, you will understand how it is possible to be changed in a positive way by tragedy and you will learn the true value of suffering. The worth of a person’s life lies not in the number of years lived; rather it rests on how well that person has absorbed the lessons of that life, how well that person has come to understand and distill the multiple, messy aspects of the human experience. While I would have chosen to stay with you for much longer had the choice been mine, if you can learn from my death, if you accepted my challenge to be better people because of my death, then that would bring my spirit inordinate joy and peace.
      
      You will feel alone and lonely, and yet, understand that you are not alone. It is true that we walk this life alone, because we feel what we feel singularly and each of us makes our own choices. But it is possible to reach out and find those like you, and in so doing you will feel not so lonely. This is another one of life’s paradoxes that you will learn to navigate. First and foremost, you have each other to lean on. You are sisters, and that gives you a bond of blood and common experiences that is like no other. Find solace in one another. Always forgive and love one another. Then there’s Daddy. Then there are Titi and Uncle Mau and Aunt Nancy and Aunt Caroline and Aunt Sue and so many dear friends, all of whom knew and loved me so well — who think of you and pray for you and worry about you. All of these people’s loving energy surrounds you so that you will not feel so alone.
      
      And last, wherever I may go, a part of me will always be with you. My blood flows within you. You have inherited the best parts of me. Even though I won’t physically be here, I will be watching over you.
      
      Sometimes, when you practice your instruments, I close my eyes so I can hear better. And when I do, I am often overcome with this absolute knowing that whenever you play the violin or the piano, when you play it with passion and commitment, the music with its special power will beckon me and I will be there. I will be sitting right there, pushing you to do it again and again and again, to count, to adjust your elbow, to sit properly. And then I will hug you and tell you how you did a great job and how very proud I am of you. I promise. Even long after you have chosen to stop playing, I will still come to you in those extraordinary and ordinary moments in life when you live with a complete passion and commitment. It might be while you’re standing atop a mountain, marveling at exceptional beauty and filled with pride in your ability to reach the summit, or when you hold your baby in your arms for the first time or when you are crying because someone or something has broken your tender heart or maybe when you’re miserably pulling an all-nighter for school or work. Know that your mother once felt as you feel and that I am there hugging you and urging you on. I promise.
      
      I have often dreamed that when I die, I will finally know what it would be like to see the world without visual impairment, to see far into the distance, to see the minute details of a bird, to drive a car. Oh, how I long to have perfect vision, even after all these years without. I long for death to make me whole, to give me what was denied me in this life. I believe this dream will come true. Similarly, when your time comes, I will be there waiting for you, so that you, too, will be given what was lost to you. I promise. But in the meantime, live, my darling babies. Live a life worth living. Live thoroughly and completely, thoughtfully, gratefully, courageously, and wisely. Live!
      
      I love you both forever and ever, to infinity, through space and time. Never ever forget that.

    content: `
    In July 2020, I had a poem published by Independent Catholic News. I think of myself as both a poet and a prose writer, but I am more experienced with publishing nonfiction prose. This was my first time attempting to publish poetry professionally.

    Through the lens of faith, my poem, “A Prayer to Shine Through,” responds to the monumental issues our world has been facing this year. Following Saint Ignatius of Loyola’s Examen prayer, the first part acknowledges that people are profoundly struggling. Inspired by the Ignatian idea of finding God in all things, the second part highlights how faith and God can still be found. The piece concludes with a prayer that we continue to see signs of hope.
    
    Though I plan to further my study of poetry as I pursue my MFA in Creative Writing, I have only taken one undergraduate poetry course. I knew that my work required more revision and craft elements to be a literary piece. I wanted to publish it anyway as it may be a source of hope for others. I also knew that literary publications typically release new issues quite some time after the work is submitted.
    
    My poem seemed like it would help people if printed during these times, not months after. News outlets appeared to be the best option. I submitted to local and national publications that printed pieces addressing faith and current events. Most depicted faith positively but hinted at struggles—a major factor influencing my decision to submit.
    
    I remember reading through the submission guidelines and cringing at the maximum accepted length—twenty lines for one magazine, forty for another. As my piece was over one hundred lines, I decided against attempting to condense to twenty—too much would be lost.  I did, however, condense to forty lines. The magazine that I was submitting to is one that I admire. I knew that, if I did not submit it, I would always wonder whether it would have been accepted.
    
    Trying to cut and move over eighty lines was a major challenge. Reading some articles helped. One discussed how line breaks emphasize ideas. I had learned this in class, but having a reminder gave a fresh perspective. Did I really need certain articles like ‘the’ and ‘a’ on their own lines? No, it seemed more effective to break a line on actual keywords, so I revised accordingly. Some stanzas mirrored others, depicting the same idea in different wording. I cut the duplicates and reworked those remaining to have the keen details of the discarded ones.
    
    Although I was pleased with my submission, I felt a faint tug of disappointment afterwards. Many revisions were for the best, but some did not do the piece justice. The editors would not see the power of the unique line breaks and repetition that had originally been there. Part of me felt like I sent a synopsis rather than the poem itself.
    
    When the rejections came, it was naturally disappointing, but it was not the end of the world. In my twenty-three years, I have seen my father die of cancer and my mother overcome the obstacles of single parenthood. I am physically disabled and rely on a motorized wheelchair and an Assistive and Augmentative Communication device. Looking at our struggles and at the world now, the rejections do not even compare.
    
    Rejections are just like paper cuts. We all must endure them regardless of age or level of experience. They appear when the writer is finally seeing the rhythm of the work—when the thought comes that this piece could actually be a page-turner. As soon as the writer moves in a direction that goes against the angle sought by editors, the rejections appear, tearing the skin of the writer.
    
    It is important to note the size and magnitude of the paper cut of rejection. It is tiny. The cut stings at first, but the sensation lasts for a matter of moments. Pain may remain in the following days, but the cut will heal, dissipating into nothing but tough skin.
    
    Too many writers mistake rejections as a sign that they do not have what it takes to succeed. Rejections do not mean that the writing is bad. Editors may love the piece and see its potential to touch readers. If its content or style is beyond the publication’s scope, they are simply not at liberty to take it.
    
    I knew I needed to keep pursuing the poem’s publication. The words, raw and honest, had flowed just right, braiding together emotion, hard truths, and bright insights. This was a piece to be shared widely. I just had to find the right avenue. I began to think more strategically than I had in previous submissions.
    
    Remembering my undergraduate publishing courses at Fairfield University, it dawned on me that it may not be a piece for mainstream publications. I knew that my poetry was not yet at that polished, literary quality that editors seek—I just did not have enough background in craft yet. I knew, too, that mainstream publications look for very specific angles and that mine did not quite fit.
    
    At Fairfield, I learned that independent publications are typically more willing to accept work that is from emerging writers and unconventional in its content, style, and form. I began researching faith-based and Catholic-based independent news outlets and discovered Independent Catholic News, a global outlet based in London, England. Its website features a poetry section showcasing the work of famous poets—Seamus Heaney, to name a personal favorite—along with emerging or lesser-known poets. The poetry focuses on celebrating faith as well as depicting the trials faced by saints, martyrs, and believers.
    
    I decided to write to the editor, sending my poem and asking if she would consider publishing it. I revised my poem so that it was the version that I would like the world to read, taking my original version and working in new wording that the condensed versions helped me discover.
    
    The site did not display submission guidelines, though, and I had no idea if the editor was seeking new works. I decided to take a risk, choosing not to write the typical query letter. I instead wrote an email explaining who I was, what had inspired the work, and my hope that it would help people. My email seemed to adequately explain my poem in a way that query letters had not.
    
    I admit that I paused quite a few times before I finished and sent it. I could not help but ponder what on Earth I thought I was doing. I was a twenty-three-year-old new college graduate and incoming graduate student in the United States, and here I was asking some editor on another continent to consider publishing my amateur poem. The chances that she would even read and respond to my note, I thought, were almost nonexistent. Yet something inside me made me continue, and I sent the email as soon as it was finished. It only took the editor a day to respond with an acceptance and a week for the poem to be published.
    
    Following its publication, I spent many days writing and responding to loved ones and acquaintances who had read the poem. I could not believe how it was spreading—just when I thought I had replied to all who had written to me, more conversations began. What strikes me is not the quantity of people. It is the words that they have shared on how the poem has brightened their days and how they have shared the piece with others. These are just the people that I know. It is astonishing to think that people across the world could be reading and reacting to my poem.
    
    When reflecting on the poem’s journey, I am astounded. I had hoped that the poem would be printed in a local or national publication. If I had not been rejected, it never would have reached the international publication. The rejections gave me an opportunity to discover and fine-tune the poem’s most effective wording and form. If I had not pursued publication after the rejection, the poem would not be where it is today.
    
    I will not urge other writers to follow the same steps I took. Every writer must have their own unique process. I will simply offer this advice: be bold. Be brave. Be fearless in your writing. Dare to explore that unfamiliar genre. Dare to use unconventional forms and themes to illustrate what the world needs to hear. Dare to seek out new avenues to get your work out there, even if it means writing to an editor on another side of the planet. Dare to manipulate the pages even after the paper cuts of rejection attempt to derail your plans.

    content: `
      Have you ever watched a magician make his assistant levitate just by waving his hands?

      Here’s what happens.  Two dancers come onto the stage to set the exotic atmosphere.  Once we’re in the mood, the magician’s assistant comes out and lies on a board supported by two chairs.
      
      The magician puts the assistant into a trance. The dancers cover the assistant with the blanket on the board.  They remove the chairs and the magician begins waving his hands.
      
      Magically, the assistant rises.  The magician passes a hoop around the assistant so we can see clearly that there are no ropes or wires lifting the board.

      Amazing!

        The audience claps and the magician does another trick.

        Impressing is a strategy.
        Wouldn’t it be great if your readers would be so riveted to your writing that nothing could stop them from reading every word?

        What writer doesn’t want that?

        Impressing is important, we’re told. If you can’t grab attention, you won’t get a chance to make an impact.

        Consider the magician.  They’re making an impression all the time, aren’t they?  And they do it so well, they don’t even have to share their hidden message.

        And what might that message be?

        It’s okay to believe in magic.

        Be careful not to overlook this fact.  The greatest magicians plan to show us that we should believe in magic.  If they just told us, then we’d dismiss it. If they didn’t plan for this, their shows wouldn’t be as good.

        When the assistant rises and we can’t see why, we’re convinced (even if only for a moment).  The magician isn’t forcing us to believe.  They’re just presenting a picture and leaving it to us to interpret what we saw.

        You impress with a headline or a startling statement to begin your blog post, your essay, or your book. Once you’ve got people’s attention, you’ve got one shot to make your message clear.

        That’s where expression comes in.

        Expression is a goal.
        What impact do you want your writing to make?

        The time to ask that question is before you write the first word.

        Knowing what you want to accomplish helps you draw a map to get you there.  What road will you lead the reader down?  What sights will the reader see along the way?  What signposts will give hints for what is to come?

        The words you choose will depend on the point you want to make.  Consider what the reader might be thinking when they find your piece.  What are they feeling?  What do they believe?  What do you want them to think or feel after they read?

        To make your message clear, narrow your focus.

        Narrowing means you pick one problem and provide a solution for it.  It means you tell one kind of story for one kind of reader.  To do more is to spread yourself thin and dilute your impact.

        When you have one main point, it’s like a tour guide that directs you as you write.  It’s the ruthless editor that helps you cut out everything that doesn’t make your point. It’s the magnifying glass that excludes everything that doesn’t add to your message.

        I grew up drinking sweet tea.  The first time or two I made it myself was a test.  I might add too much sugar or too much water.  Or maybe too many tea bags.  When it doesn’t taste right, you might suffer through a glass or two, but you can’t bring yourself to drink a whole gallon.

        Your writing is a lot like sweet tea.  If you want your readers to enjoy your writing while they drink it in, suit it to their taste.  Be willing to test—and fail.  Analyze what happened, adjust your focus, and try again.  In time and with practice, you’ll find the right recipe.

        You need both to make an impact.
        To influence people, you have to draw them to you.

        It’s not enough to open the door.  You’ve got to have something appealing inside.  If you bore them after you grab their attention, they’ll walk out on you.

        TV producers are experts at this.  They tantalize you with the juiciest clips while you’re watching something else.  If they succeed, then they have to make watching so good you’ll go on a binge.

        Think about your favorite shows.  What got you hooked?  What makes them so good you want to tell all your friends about them?

        Here are a few:

        Open loops – They show you a problem but withhold the solution until you watch. Characters you can identify with – When the hero seems like you, you think of them as a friend.  You see yourself in their shoes.  You may even find yourself rooting for them or talking to the screen to tell them what to do.
        They sell hope – Have you had a bad day and want to laugh? Do you want to be as confident or skilled as your favorite character?  A few minutes escape can be just what the doctor ordered.
        What can you add to this list?

        Then ask yourself, “How can I use these techniques in my own writing?”

        If you need help, take out one of your favorite author’s books.  Read for an hour.  Then grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage) and write down the ways they capture your attention.

        Then grab a pen and implement those techniques into your own writing.

      In the Spring of 2016, my book, Align Your Writing Habits to Success, hit #1 in my category on Amazon and I became a bestselling author. That same year, two more of my books also hit #1. It happened again the next year and again two years later. 

      Now, it’s pretty common for me to release a new book and have it hit #1 in my category.
      
      But before that, being an Amazon Bestselling author was a pipe dream. Something I knew was possible for other people, but I didn’t think it was for me.
      
      Why did I think it was a pipe dream? Two reasons:

    I didn’t know How to make it happen 
    I had a limiting belief that said it wasn’t possible for me
    Then in February of 2016, I met an author who had written and published 47 books, 46 of which hit #1 in her category on Amazon. Meeting her got me thinking: if she could hit #1 that many times, surely I could do it once. 

    That thought shifted everything for me, and less than four months later, I joined the ranks of Amazon Bestselling authors. 

    Limiting beliefs run rampant in your subconscious mind, and these beliefs stop you from pursuing your desires and believing your dreams are not only possible, but inevitable. And if you don’t deal with your limiting beliefs, they will hold you back from ever having the writing career and the life you truly want.

    First, what is a limiting belief? It’s a belief that limits what’s possible and available for you. 

    Limiting beliefs are rooted in misperception, and everyone has them. It’s your job to figure out what yours are, then deal with them, and let them go. 

    To get you started, here are 13 of the most common limiting beliefs I see from writers and creatives (and why they’re not actually true): 

    Writers are broke
    This one has been said so many times it plays like a broken record in many writers’ minds. 

    Not only does this limiting belief stop you from making money as a writer, but it also stops you from even doing your writing or putting it out into the world. If you think from the get-go that being a writer means you’ll be broke, why would you ever allow yourself to be a writer? 

    But the truth is, not all writers are broke. I’d argue the only writers who are broke are the writers who aren’t resourceful, who haven’t done the due diligence to learn what it takes to make money from being a writer, and who haven’t consistently implemented what they’ve learned.

    And I would argue this because if you are resourceful, you do learn what it takes to make money as a writer, and you implement it consistently, you will make money eventually. That’s how it works. 

    You’re only a published author if your book was traditionally published 
    Let’s look at the very basic definition of published: to prepare and issue a piece of work for readership or sale to the public. With this definition, a blog post–much like this one–makes you a published author. 

    Same goes for self-publishing your book(s). 

    If you’ve prepared your book and issued it for readership or sale to the public–congratulations, you’re a published author. If someone can find your book on Amazon and read it and/or buy it, you’re a published author. It really is that simple.

    The problem is when you allow someone else’s limiting beliefs around what it means to be a published author affect you and the way you think about yourself and your writing.

    I shouldn’t have to spend money to be successful as an author 
    You’ve probably heard the old saying, “you have to spend money to make money.” You’ve maybe even said that yourself or believed it at some point. 

    But that doesn’t mean it’s ultimately true for everyone. It is possible to make money without spending money. 

    The real question is: do you want to be a hobbyist or a professional? 

    A hobbyist writer doesn’t see the value of investing in their writing career. A professional writer knows that allowing yourself to be supported by investing your money in whatever you need for your career–be that an editor, a coach, a cover designer, a how-to book or course, or something else entirely–is a win-win. 

    That doesn’t mean you have to spend a ton of money to be a professional. This is more about making a mindset shift from not seeing the value in investing in your writing career to seeing that when you invest in your career, that investment returns to you in multiple ways, money included.

    Writing isn’t a career with longevity
    Ugh, I hate this one! And I get it. I really do.

    As a writer who was told many times that writing “isn’t a real job,” I can tell you with absolute certainty writing is a career with longevity. I’ve been getting paid for my writing since 2001. All these years later, still getting paid.

    The issue at hand here is two-fold: 

    Are you willing to stay the course? 
    Are you willing to pivot and learn new things as the industry and marketplace shifts and changes? 
    While being a writer is still the same thing as it has always been–sit down and put words on the page–the way writers sell their books and make money from their writing has shifted over the years, and will continue to.

    content: `As copywriters, we feel very strongly that words are just as important to a marketing or website design project (and their respective project names) as any other element. Pantone red 32 and Hipster Comic Neue might convey your brand values perfectly, but without words, no one knows what you're doing or why you're doing it.

    And yet, we continue to see lorem ipsum filling up wireframes and templates as if the communication part of the whole process can just be slotted in at the end. (You can probably tell, we at Articulate feel pretty strongly about this. Lorem ipsum is usually a sign of a failed design process.)
    **Living with lorem ipsum**
    So, if some of you project managers and designers will still insist on generating a bunch of meaningless placeholder text to put 'where the words go', at least make it entertaining.

    Here are 10 of the best, most awesome lorem ipsum generators that we've come across lately and a little taster of the text they generate:

    -Borat Ipsum. I sorry to interrupt the politic. Uh, please, is possible make a shit, your house, immediately, very urgent, I have a problem, please?
    -Corporate Ipsum. Objectively innovate empowered manufactured products whereas parallel platforms. Holisticly predominate extensible testing procedures for reliable supply chains. Dramatically engage top-line web services vis-a-vis cutting-edge deliverables.
    -Hipster Ipsum. Seitan salvia wayfarers health goth organic cliche, banjo narwhal vinyl direct trade lomo blog iPhone.
    -Samuel L. Ipsum. Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.
    -Whedon Ipusm. (I'm so exited this one exists!) Magic's all balderdash and chicanery. Woman, you are completely off your nut. I told him that I loved him, I kissed him, and I killed him. Anything for you, because I love you. Deep, deep man love. Easy as really difficult pie. Darn your sinister attraction!
    -The postmodernism generator. If one examines precapitalist nihilism, one is faced with a choice: either reject dialectic neocapitalist theory or conclude that expression is a product of the masses
    -Zombie Ipsum. Qui animated corpse, cricket bat max brucks terribilem incessu zomby. The voodoo sacerdos flesh eater, suscitat mortuos comedere carnem virus.

      "How can new advances in digital technology help conserve the planet’s freshwater resources?",
    content: `If our world was named for what covers most of the planet, it would be called Ocean: Over seven-tenths of the Earth’s surface is water. While this seems a bountiful proportion, around 97 percent of the world’s water is saline, and much of the remaining freshwater is frozen. In fact, only 1 percent of the Earth’s water is readily available for human use in homes, farms or manufacturing. Meanwhile, on land, the number of people continues to mushroom. With the world population expected to grow to 10 billion by 2050, managing the use of freshwater resources is becoming ever more critical.
    ‍
    As a chief support of human life, water fuels the global economy, essential for manufacturing, energy production and more. In agriculture, for example, soil water — the rainfall held in soil that feeds plants, vegetables, fruits and the grass livestock eats — is the most important single component in food production, says Tony Allan, professor emeritus of geography at SOAS University of London. “And yet, it is politically and economically invisible.” 
    
    As climate change contributes to more frequent water shortages, water use and its economic impact are coming under closer scrutiny. In response to the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, which include the availability and sustainable management of water, countries and companies are increasing asking how they can better husband water resources.
    
    ## The Value of Virtual Water
    \n
    Professor Allan coined the concept of virtual water as a way of raising awareness of how we use this precious asset. “Virtual water is the water embedded in the production of a commodity,” he explains.
    
    A cup of coffee, for example, may at face value represent only a few ounces of water, but add in that used for growing the beans, packaging and shipping, and the amount rises to 140 liters. On a larger scale, to produce a ton of wheat requires over 1,000 tons of water, while producing a ton of beef needs 15 times as much. Manufacturing takes a similar toll on water resources: Making one car can require up to 150,000 liters of water.
    
    Multiply these figures exponentially as world demand grows, and the pressure on freshwater resources is clear. “The planet cannot continue to function as both canteen and latrine when it comes to our industrial needs,” says Professor Allan. “We should be looking at things critically and doing the right thing, which is to understand the value of water.”
    
    While the concept of virtual water is crucial to understanding water use, translating this understanding into concrete, sustainable practices requires specific tools. As Professor Allan says, “When there is panic, the question that comes to the political mind is: Where can we get more water? Rather, we need to ask: How can we use our water better? There is no way of getting the right answer with the wrong question.”`,

    description:
      "Mr. Yang has brought political star power and a dose of optimism to the New York City mayor’s race. But his gaps in knowledge about how the city functions have led to the perception among critics that he is out of his depth.",
    content: `As Andrew Yang approached the corner store in Manhattan, a cameraperson in tow, the setting seemed familiar. It couldn’t be that bodega — the place he visited in the infancy of his mayoral campaign, the place that brought him ridicule because it wasn’t really a bodega in the New York sense, with its bright lights, wide aisles and well-stocked shelves.

    Oh, but it was. Mr. Yang had returned to the scene of an early campaign crisis, a place that was to be a simple backdrop for a seemingly innocuous tweet in January in support of bodegas. Instead, New Yorkers questioned his knowledge and authenticity — a hint of the criticism that would follow many of his quick takes on matters both substantive and light.
    
    Mr. Yang was unfazed, then and now. He entered the 7 Brothers Famous Deli in Hell’s Kitchen, greeted the workers like they were old friends, and repeated his order from his first visit: green tea and a handful of bananas.
    “Just like the old days,” he said, before affixing a campaign poster to the storefront window.

    With less than one month to go before a Democratic primary that will almost certainly determine the next mayor of New York City, Mr. Yang’s off-the-cuff, can-do persona has fueled his candidacy in a city just emerging from the pandemic.
    His failed bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination brought national focus to universal basic income, and gave him instant name recognition, good will and political star power in the New York City contest.
    But Mr. Yang’s apparent eagerness to please, his willingness to make unorthodox, sometimes spontaneous policy pronouncements, his lack of experience with New York City politics and gaps in knowledge about how the city works have all contributed to the perception among critics that he is out of his depth — underscoring his potential weakness as a mayoral candidate.
    For Mr. Yang, his front-runner status in the New York City mayoral race has taken some getting used to. In private conversations this year, he has come across as supremely confident about his chances. But he can also seem taken aback by the increasingly sharp criticism he attracts.
    “I’m frankly a bit more accustomed to being the, like, the scrappy underdog —that was sort of a more natural posture for me,” he said in an interview this spring.

    He seemed, at the outset of the race, to satisfy some New Yorkers’ psychic needs. But in the final weeks before the June 22 primary, as the city reawakens, the race’s dynamics have changed. Polls have tightened, voters are paying more attention, and well-funded competitors are spending millions on television, threatening a victory that once seemed well within Mr. Yang’s grasp.

    ## An affinity for the underdog
    \n
    Mr. Yang was born 46 years ago to Taiwanese immigrants living in Schenectady, N.Y., then known as Electric City, presumably for the central role that his father’s employer, General Electric, played in its economy. When he was four, his family moved from a home there with a green shag carpet to Westchester County.

    His parents were both technologically oriented: His father worked at I.B.M.; his mother, who had a master’s degree in statistics, worked for the State University of New York at Purchase as the director of computer services, before becoming an artist.

    Mr. Yang recalled a relatively homogeneous upbringing: In his middle school class in Somers, N.Y., he remembered one other East Asian student, a girl.

    “Everyone said we should date, which made neither of us very happy,” said Mr. Yang, who would be New York’s first Asian American mayor.
